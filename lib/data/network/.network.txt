This directory is where the network (service) layer lives. It handles all communication with external APIs (e.g., login, registration, fetching data).
The files in this directory are responsible for sending HTTP requests, receiving responses, and handling any network-specific errors or configurations.
This layer simply fetches raw data from the internet—it doesn’t process or transform the data.
Example: The AuthService class makes requests to the backend for login and registration, receiving raw responses from the API.
